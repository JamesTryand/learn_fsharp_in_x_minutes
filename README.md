# Learn F# in x minutes - intro
An attempt at a very terse F# learning list

### Basics
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Primitive types (remember: still .NET)
- [ ] Tuples
- [ ] Pipelines
- [ ] Composition
- [ ] F# Collection types
- [ ] Record types
- [ ] Discriminated Union types
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Recursive functions
- [ ] Option types
- [ ] Classes & Interfaces (OOP still exists)
- [ ] Using Computation Expressions (async, result, etc made even easier)

That should cover enough to build apps & have a play. Go out there and build awesome stuff! :)

Much more to explore when you need it / feel comfortable.
